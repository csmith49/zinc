# TRUMP
Trump is an exercise in sensitivity analysis. It is a tool that is capable of determining the sensitivity of functions encodable in a deciable first-order theory.

## Requirements
Trump is dependent on `pta` a term algebra library that exists [here](https://github.com/csmith49/pta).

## Usage
Trump takes the location of a single file in SMT-LIB format as input. See the test file for an example of the extended syntax.
